### Work on Urbansounds classification

Notebooks to convert .wav files into .png files as well as the training steps.
No fine tuning, no major transformations, no regularizations. Just basic off the shelf resnet 34 and resnet 50 models deployed on ten different classes of urban sounds.
The data as well as the idea is from DCASE 2018 conference.
Will add more details soon.
